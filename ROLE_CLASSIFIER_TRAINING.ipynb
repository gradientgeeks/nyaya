    "### 📚 Practical Strategies to Handle \"None\" Dominance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Strategy 1: Class Weights (RECOMMENDED - Already Enabled)**\n",
    "✅ **What it does**: Multiplies the loss for each class inversely proportional to its frequency\n",
    "- \"None\" (abundant) → Low weight (e.g., 0.2x)\n",
    "- \"Issue\" (rare) → High weight (e.g., 5.0x)\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Pros**: \n",
    "- Easy to implement\n",
    "- No data loss\n",
    "- Works well for moderate imbalance\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Cons**: May not fully solve severe imbalance (>50x ratio)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Strategy 2: Filter \"None\" Samples**\n",
    "What it does: Randomly discard some \"None\" samples to balance the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example: Keep only 30% of \"None\" samples\n",
    "imbalance_config[\"filter_none_samples\"] = True\n",
    "imbalance_config[\"none_keep_ratio\"] = 0.3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Pros**: Directly balances the dataset\n",
    "❌ **Cons**: Loses potentially useful data\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Strategy 3: Stratified Sampling**\n",
    "What it does: Ensure each batch has balanced representation of all classes\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Pros**: Guarantees balanced learning in each batch\n",
    "❌ **Cons**: Requires custom data loader\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Strategy 4: Two-Stage Training**\n",
    "1. **Stage 1**: Train on balanced subset (filter \"None\" heavily)\n",
    "2. **Stage 2**: Fine-tune on full dataset with class weights\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Pros**: Best of both worlds\n",
    "❌ **Cons**: Takes more time\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 **Recommended Approach for Your Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the file analysis showing severe \"None\" dominance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start with**: Class weights (already enabled in config)\n",
    "2. **If results are poor**: Enable \"None\" filtering:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   imbalance_config[\"filter_none_samples\"] = True\n",
    "   imbalance_config[\"none_keep_ratio\"] = 0.4  # Keep 40% of \"None\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. **Monitor**: Per-class F1 scores (especially for \"Issue\", \"Decision\")\n",
    "4. **Adjust**: If minority classes still perform poorly, reduce `none_keep_ratio` to 0.2-0.3"
